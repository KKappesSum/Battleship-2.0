begins the game. 

File Name\+: exec.\+cpp.

Assignment\+: E\+E\+CS 448 Project 1. Brief\+: This program is the .cpp file for the exec class. It runs the game. First ask number of ships. create player\+One\+Map with that number, allowing them to place. repeat with player\+Two\+Map. begin looping using while loop, using the game\+Over() function to know when to stop. each loop prints a shot map and their own map, then allows player to fire on the others board. Once a game\+Over() kills the loop, congratulate the winning player. delete maps. end code.

A\+S\+C\+II conversion done with online generator, \href{http://patorjk.com/software/taag/}{\texttt{ http\+://patorjk.\+com/software/taag/}}.

If input is good, cast to int for map creation and end loop for menu.

Quitting the program by returning and skipping gameplay phase.

Start of gamplay phase.

Each player takes turns placing ships in the map class.

player one start.

Where they have shot.

Their own map.

Continually ask until valid coordinate is given.

fire shot at given coordintate.

If the shot ended the game, break gameplay loop.

Reset coordinate to avoid infinite loop of both players firing on same spot.

Player 2 start, repeating same process.

If all player 2 ships have been sunk, player 1 wins.

Opposite condition and player 2 has won.

de-\/allocate memory.
